## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name's Alejandro, from Chile. I'm getting back into software development after a while and boy, I'm excited to be here.

- ðŸ”­ Currently I'm focusing on Django app development. So, mainly Python, HTML and JS. Starting to learn some React too!
- ðŸŒ± Other languages and technologies I've learned are C, C++, Java and MatLab. I've worked in the past in automation, so I'm no stranger to PLCs and instrumentation. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Looking for new oportunities in the IT industry! Just starting in this world.
- ðŸ’¬ I speak english and spanish fluently. Also some french!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Contact me via [email](mailto:alej.of.19@gmail.com?subject=[GitHub]) or to my LinkedIn (up, but currently in construction)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I once programmed a cockroach :)
